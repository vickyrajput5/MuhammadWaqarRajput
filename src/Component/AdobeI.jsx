        <b>.</b> Depending on the specialty or project, the Illustrator may need an understanding of medicine or science or even how mechanical things work together. For example, if the Illustrator creates medical school textbook drawings, they may need to know human anatomy or understand some of the mechanics of cell structure. If they create dental textbook drawings, they’ll need to know about oral hygiene or dental bone structure. Perhaps the Illustrator is working on flora and fauna; an understanding of botany would be important. <br/>
